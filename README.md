# invert-color
Invert.js is the original version, use script.js, the obfuscated version in your website if you don't want people copying the code.<br/>
Also some sites like GitHub sadly don't let you use the obfuscated version, so if that happens feel free to just use Invert.js!<br/>
### You have to include a link to my repo for credit. All that matters is a link, it can even be hidden in your README or JavaScript if you don't really want a link in the middle of your page.
